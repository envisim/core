## Functions

| Function                                                      | theme_description                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [areaOfRing](functions/areaOfRing.md)                         | Computes the area of a polygon ring where the segments are the shortest (geodesic) paths between the points.                                                                         |
| [destination](functions/destination.md)                       | Computes the destination point on a geodesic path given a point, a distance and an azimuth.                                                                                          |
| [destinationUnrolled](functions/destinationUnrolled.md)       | Computes the destination point on a geodesic path given a point, a distance and an azimuth.                                                                                          |
| [distance](functions/distance.md)                             | Computes the shortest distance in meters between two point coordinates.                                                                                                              |
| [forwardAzimuth](functions/forwardAzimuth.md)                 | Computes the forward azimuth (angle from north) from the first point to the second point for a geodesic path between the points. The azimuth takes values in the range -180 to +180. |
| [forwardAzimuthDistance](functions/forwardAzimuthDistance.md) | Computes the forward azimuth (angle from north) from the first point to the second point for a geodesic path between the points. The azimuth takes values in the range -180 to +180. |
| [intermediate](functions/intermediate.md)                     | Computes an intermediate point on a geodesic path given a start point, an end point and the fraction of the distance.                                                                |
